### Hey
I am Harmeet, an experienced professional with a passion for lifelong learning, mentoring and advocating open source, I am a bibliophile with an analytical mind, dedicated to continuous growth and innovation. Other than code, I enjoy working on IoT projects and reading about cybersecurity. My experience as an SDET is the reason I think of automating anything and everything around me.

The repos are
- Tech and projects I am curious about and try to learn by doing
- Tips and tricks I think I should keep handy for later use
- Stuff I use for trainings and sessions
